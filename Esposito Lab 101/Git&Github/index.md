### So you learned how to write good code, what now?

You learn how to save it appropriately with _version control software_ (VCS), our favorite is Git! 

### Git + GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is one of the backbones of the modern software world (read as: everyone is using it so you should too).
It's a piece of _version control software_ (VCS), which basically means it'll track your changes for you and make sure that if two people are working on the same chunk of code, they don't accidentally overwrite each other's work.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is one of the big reasons git has gotten as popular as it has.
Basically a code hosting service, they allow you to put your `git` version-controlled code on the web so that you can easily share it with others.
This website is actually hosted through GitHub and the underlying content is version controlled with `git` (which means you can also go back in time and see what it originally looked like, if you want to).

Both of these will give you peace of mind that if something breaks, you can figure out where it broke.

All of the lab computers all have `git` installed and is accessible through the command line. 

### Is this all new to you?
No big deal! If you are taking the time to learn how to write code, you should take the time to learn how to save it.
