Dr. Esposito obtained his Bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of South Carolina. 
There, he worked with Dr. Susan Richardson studying disinfection by-products in drinking water. 
During his undergraduate studies, Dr. Esposito spent a summer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center where he first 
became interested in astrochemistry.

Following his undergraduate studies, he earned his PhD. in Physical Chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania. 
He was co-advised by Dr. Marsha Lester and Dr. Joseph Francisco. During his graduate studies, Dr. Esposito used 
computational methods to study the rotational, vibrational, and electronic spectroscopy of small, metal-bearing 
molecules of astrochemical interest as well as their photochemical pathways. Additionally, he studied the reaction 
dynamics and photochemistry of Criegee intermediates via experimental and computational methods.

Before coming to Chapman, Dr. Esposito was a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
CA where he studied the absorption and emission spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These are big 
carbon sheets, often with hydrogens around the outside, but sometimes with other substituents like deuterium and cyano.
