The Esposito lab at Chapman University specializes in the computational chemistry exploration of  Astrochemistry. 
Research in the Esposito Lab uses computational chemistry (quantum chemistry) techniques to investigate the chemical 
properties of molecules in space. This work spans across the electromagnetic spectrum in the form of photochemistry and 
electronic spectroscopy (UV/vis), vibrational spectroscopy (infrared), and rotational spectroscopy (microwave/radio). 
Only 90 years ago, space was thought to be an empty vacuum. Since then, over 300 molecules have been detected in space 
with the help of powerful telescopes, sophisticated laboratory experiments, and advanced computational techniques 
(termed the "triangle of astrochemistry"). The Esposito Lab at Chapman forms one small piece of this triangle, and 
through many domestic and international collaborations, we hope to arrive at a deeper understanding of our Universe.

Esposito Lab 101 is a self guided intro to the methods used in the lab. It was written with the intention of getting people ready and thinking about the kinds of problems we approach.
